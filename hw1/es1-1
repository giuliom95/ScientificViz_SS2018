Cons:
- It is not immediatly clear what is the purpouse of the chart is.
- No clarity of which perentage is depicted.
- It has a very redundand labeling. E.G.: No need for "BTC" repetitions.
- It's cluttered in the bottom side.
- No clear symbol/color legend. (It took 5 minutes for three people to figure it out)
- It resembles a pie chart but is not. And even if it was a pie chart, this is not the best way to present this kind of data relatioships.
- The diagram tries to show the "shattering" of the bitcoin market, but it fails miserably.

Cons:
- No time range specified
- Relation between number of painkillers and number of people is not clear at all.
- At first glance, the chart seems to represent a bell-like painkiller distribution between the population which it is not consistent with data and the upper arrow (color code and direction)
- There are only three labeled categories ("Lowest", "Average", "Highest") but there are five intervals
- No need for the repetition of the "Number of painkiller prescription per 100 people"
Pro:
- The couples state/numbers of painkillers are straightfroward.
- The color scheme is appropriate
