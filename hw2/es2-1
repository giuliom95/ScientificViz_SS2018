1) Data aquisition
    We got this from sensor data (an MRI scan probably)
2) Filtering
    We need to filter out unneeded tissues and just focus on the aneurysm.
    A) Filter out the noise that comes from the sensors.
    B) Filter out irrelevant data to tissue unneded for representation.
3) Mapping
    3D field -> volume
    scalar field (probably the density of the brain tissues) -> color
4) Rendering
    3d volume perspective rendering
    
1) Domain: 1D; Attribute: 1D; Scale type: Ordinal
    The rod is thin so we can just assume it's a 1d domain.
    The temperature is a set of 1D ordinal values by definition.
2) Domain: 2D; Attribute: 0D; Scale type: Nominal
    Normally a map is a 2D domain.
    The attributes are not related to each other.
3) Domain: 3D; Attribute: 3D; Scale type: Ordinal
    A car is a physical object so it's 3D.
    The air flow is defined by 3D vectors
4) Domain: 1D; Atrribute: 1D; Scale Type: Ordinal
    Even if roads are usually graphically represented as 2D, each road individually can be considered as a 1D segment and every segment can be mapped in a unique 1D domain.
    Traffic can be indicated by just a scalar and then it can be mapped to a color like Google Maps does.
5) Domain: 2D; Attribute: 1D; Scale Type: Ordinal
    Every point of earth can be represented on a 2D domain.
    The time is a scalar.
